**Thomas Brusilovsky's Soundscape Narrative:**  
*'An Unfortune Summer Hike'*  
An Unfortunate Summer Hike tells the story of just that, a wonderful hike through the woods cut short by an afternoon thunderstorm. The listener follows the journy of the hapless hiker, first enjoying the wonderful weather, and then fleeing to his car to escape the rain.   

The final soundscape file can be found in the *MP3's* folder, named *An Unfortune Summeer Hike.mp3*.
