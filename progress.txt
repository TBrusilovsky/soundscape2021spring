Work so far:
In this step, I have so far included some of the 'nature' sounds that I plan to have in the background of my piece. I have one track of bird song that I am planning to repeat, though I may try to find more variety in order to reduce the repetive nature of using such a short clip. I also have the rain that I am planning to use, though I am not yet certian about the current positioning. Finally I have the wind, I am very happy with this particular track but it is longer than neccisarry for this project and I plan to move it around and trim pieces in order to have the wind blowing with the strength and volume I want at the correct points. For instance, I plan to move one of the area's where the wind picks up suddenly to right before I begin  my rain track. 
My next step is to add more depth, I plan to layer in some running water and likely a greater variety of animal noises. Only then will I work to add the more human elements to the track, such as footsteps, car door, breathing, etc. I may also add a different rain track at the end, to represent that the person is no longer outside but has gotten to shelter, since rain sounds differently impacting on solid objects than on the canopy of trees. 
My biggest issue so far has been properly arranging the wind audio. I choose a rather long clip as it had the sound closest to what I wanted, but this means I have a lot of work to do in rearanging everything and making sure the portions I want line up where I want them to. As of now, I am quite unhappy with how it is coming together. I also am currently looking for a slightly softer rain clip, as I am not sure I like how the rain just abruptly starts at such a level of strength. Alternativly, I may make the rain track quiter for the first portion, so that it sounds like it gets stronger over time.
