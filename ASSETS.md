Created Assets: 

Footsteps
Car door
Running footsteps
Water running
Wind in the trees
Heavy breathing
Rain of varying stregth and local

Solution: I plan to record all of these myself, however some of these are rather weather dependent so if I am unable to get them I will find fair use assets that fit my needs.
